    "description": "Rhythm of the Dance has brought audiences around the world to their feet for over two decades and is returning with a brand new production.\n\nRooted in Ireland's rich culture and heritage, the show takes a different perspective on all things Irish. Featuring world class live musicians, vocalists and champion dancers, the show will be a completely immersive experience.\n\nJoin us on a journey through Ireland's history from the ancient, rich in legend and myth, to the modern, urban Ireland that we see today, bursting at the seams, now more than ever with talent.\n\nRhythm of the Dance is an array of everything Irish dance has evolved into, from its roots in 'Sean Nos' (meaning old-style), to the militant, clean, modern style we see on stage today. \n\nWith lyrical and contemporary influences, it will be Irish in essence, with a new edge and promises to be an exploration of how far you can push the boundaries of Irish dance.",
